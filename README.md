# Tower_Defense GAME

The goal of this project is to implement a simplistic (or not) tower defence game. Here are the basic requirements :
- Single-player
- Player can create and/or destroy tower.
- Random enemies
- The towers attack when the enemy is in range of attack. â€¢ enemy can defeat you.

GIF may be a bit slow, but the game works fast

The player moves with arrows <- ->, and towers are removed and added with buttons A (add) and D (delete)
